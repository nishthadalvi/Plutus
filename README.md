A web-app designed to control impulse shopping online through sending reminders everytime an item is added to cart and allowing the user to defer the purchase in order to stick to their predetermined budget. Built using React and Chakra UI. Accompanied by a chrome extension that is pending approval in the Chrome web store. 

This web app was developed by  UT Austin's Texas Convergent Ecommerce-Spending subteam and won 'Best Business' at the Spring 2022 Demo Day.
